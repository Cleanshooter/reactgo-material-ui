# reactGo Material UI

This is a clone of reactGo (commit d5f71395f8eca8a0d9a1be162bbd20674d7cdcdd).  If you want to learn how this boilerplate works please check the docs on the original repo.  

The reason I'm sharing this repo is becasue including the Material UI components isn't really straight forward and for those who don't want to go through the pain of learning webpack and just want to get going this might save you some setup time.  

##Get started

1. Clone (or copy) this repo.
2. npm install (in the directory where the package.json is)
3. Start your mongo DB up (however you choose... I'm using the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) )
3. npm run dev
